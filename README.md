# Music Store data analysis

## Project Summary Report:

• Analyzed music store data by answering several SQL questions on different levels of difficulty.

• Identified the senior-most employee based on job title, countries with the most invoices, top 3 values of total invoice, city with the best customers, and the best customer.

• Selected the rock music listeners by email, first name, last name, and genre, and sorted the list alphabetically by email.

• Invited the top 10 rock bands based on the artist name and total track count.

• Returned the track names that have a song length longer than the average song length and ordered by song length with the longest songs listed first.

• Found the amount spent by each customer on artists, returned customer name, artist name, and total spent.

• Identified the most popular music genre for each country and returned each country along with the top genre. For countries where the maximum number of purchases is shared, returned all genres.

• Applied various SQL commands, including SELECT, JOIN, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, LIMIT, and WITH, to write the queries.
